    </p>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>

    </ul>

    <p>We do not create user profiles or sell any form of data.</p>

    <h2>GDPR Privacy</h2>

    <h3>Legal Basis for Processing</h3>
    <p>
    This Service does not intentionally collect or process Personal Data. However, certain third-party Service Providers 
    (such as analytics providers) may process limited technical or aggregated information as part of their normal operation. 
    Where applicable, such processing may occur under these legal bases:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Consent: You have given consent for specific processing activities, including the use of non-essential cookies where applicable.</li>
      <li>Legal obligations: Processing is necessary for compliance with applicable law.</li>
      <li>Legitimate interests: Processing is necessary for the legitimate interests pursued by the Service Provider, such as 
          measuring usage, detecting abuse, or ensuring service integrity.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    If consent is required in your jurisdiction, you may withdraw it at any time.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Your Rights Under GDPR</h3>
    <p>
    If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom, or a region with similar protections, you have the right to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Withdraw consent for any processing that relies on it.</li>
      <li>Request information about how third-party Service Providers process data.</li>
      <li>Object to certain types of processing, including profiling where applicable.</li>
      <li>Lodge a complaint with a data protection authority in your region.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
    Because this Service does not collect Personal Data, rights such as access, correction, deletion, or data portability 
    generally do not apply to information stored locally on your device or to anonymous analytics data. These rights may apply 
    to any external Service Providers that process data independently under their own policies.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
    The Service is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect or store personally identifiable 
    information from children. If you believe that a child has provided Personal Data to us, please contact us so we can assist in addressing the issue.
    </p>
    <p>
    If consent is required for processing under applicable law, and the user is a minor in their jurisdiction, consent may need 
    to be provided by a parent or legal guardian before data may be collected or processed.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>
    <p>
    The Service may contain links to external websites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will 
    be directed to that website. We strongly recommend reviewing the Privacy Policy of every website you visit.
    </p>
    <p>
    We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, policies, or data-handling practices of any third-party 
    websites or services.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Privacy &amp; Cookies Policy</h2>
    <p>
    We may update this Privacy &amp; Cookies Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the 
    “Last updated” date at the top of the Policy will be revised accordingly. Changes become effective as soon as they are published.
    </p>
    <p>
    You are encouraged to review this Policy periodically to stay informed about how information is handled and how cookies or 
    third-party services may be used on the Service.
    </p>

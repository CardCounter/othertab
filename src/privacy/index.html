    <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: 2025-11-25</em></p>
    
    <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used, and disclosed when you access 
    other tab (the “Service”). The Service is operated by an individual website owner (“we”, “us”, or “our”). 
    This policy also explains how local browser storage is used and outlines your rights under laws such as the GDPR.
    </p>
    
    <p>By using the Service, you agree to the practices described in this policy.</p>
    
    <h2>Definitions</h2>

        <li>Service refers to the website located at <a href="https://othertab.com" target="_blank">https://othertab.com</a></li>
        <li>Device means any device capable of accessing the Service.</li>
        <li>Personal Data means any information that identifies an individual. This Service does not collect Personal Data.</li>

    </ul>
    
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    
    <h3>No Personal Data Collected</h3>
    <p>
    The Service does not require account creation, login, or submission of any identifying information. 
    We do not collect, store, or process Personal Data.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Local Storage</h3>
    <p>
    Game progress, settings, and preferences may be stored locally in your browser. This information never leaves your device 
    and can be cleared at any time through your browser’s settings.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Usage Data (Non-Personal)</h3>
    <p>
    Basic non-identifiable information may be collected automatically, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Pages visited</li>
    <li>Time and date of visits</li>
    <li>Referring website</li>
    <li>General device or browser type</li>
    <li>Aggregate interaction statistics</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This information does not identify you and cannot be traced back to you.</p>
    
    <h2>Detailed Information on the Processing of Information</h2>
    <p>
    The Service may use third-party Service Providers that collect or process aggregated, anonymous information 
    related to your activity on the Service. These third parties operate under their own Privacy Policies.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Analytics</h3>
    <p>We use third-party analytics to understand general usage patterns.</p>
    
    <h4>GoatCounter</h4>
    <p>
    GoatCounter is a privacy-focused analytics service. It does not use cookies and does not collect personally identifiable 
    information. GoatCounter records only anonymous, aggregate statistics such as page views, referrers, and device types. 
    This data cannot identify you and is not combined with other datasets.
    </p>
    <p>

    <a href="https://www.goatcounter.com/help/privacy" target="_blank">https://www.goatcounter.com/help/privacy</a>
    </p>
    
    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>
    Since no Personal Data is collected, the limited anonymous information we receive is used only to:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Operate and maintain the Service</li>
    <li>Understand aggregate usage patterns</li>
    <li>Comply with legal requirements</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>We do not create user profiles or sell any form of data.</p>
    
    <h2>GDPR Privacy</h2>
    
    <h3>Legal Basis for Processing</h3>
    <p>
    The Service does not intentionally collect or process Personal Data. Third-party analytics providers may process limited 
    technical data (such as anonymized browser or page view information). This processing may occur under legal bases such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Legitimate interests (e.g., service performance, basic analytics)</li>
      <li>Legal obligations (where applicable)</li>
      <li>Consent (only if your region requires consent for analytics, even without cookies)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    If consent is required in your region, you may withdraw it at any time.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Your Rights Under GDPR</h3>
    <p>
    If you are located in the EEA, UK, or a region with similar protections, you have the right to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Withdraw consent, where applicable</li>
      <li>Request information about how third-party analytics services process data</li>
      <li>Object to certain types of processing</li>
      <li>Lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
    Because this Service does not collect Personal Data, rights such as access, correction, deletion, or portability do not 
    apply to information stored on your own device or to anonymous analytics data.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
    The Service is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect or store information from children. 
    If you believe a child has provided any form of data, please contact us so we can help resolve the issue.
    </p>
    <p>
    If your region requires parental consent for any type of data processing and the user is a minor, such consent may be necessary.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>
    <p>
    The Service may contain links to external websites. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of those sites. 
    We recommend reviewing their Privacy Policies before providing information or using their services.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the 
    “Last updated” date will be revised. Changes take effect as soon as the updated policy is posted.
    </p>
